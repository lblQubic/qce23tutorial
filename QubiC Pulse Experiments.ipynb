    "Introduction\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "QubiC is capable of playing arbitrary pulses for qubit drive and readout, allowing you to get the most out of your quantum hardware by controlling the precise timing and dynamics.\n",
    "It comes with APIs that give you full control, but resource efficiency is key to scaling and quick experiment turnaround.\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is therefore to show how to efficiently construct a pulse-based experiment in QubiC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulse Nomenclature\n",

    "<table style=\"padding: 0px\"><tr></tr><tr>\n",

    "<div align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 120%\">\n",
    "<p>A <i>pulse</i> is series of output voltages at specific time stamps.\n",
    "It is constructed by first defining a pulse <i>envelope</i> at regular steps called <i>samples</i>.\n",
    "For example, an envelope could take the form of a Gaussian shape, with at each sample the value corresponding to a Gaussian function.\n",
    "Samples become time stamps by specifying to QubiC the <i>sample rate</i> and <i>interpolation ratio</i> to get the number of samples played per second.</p>\n",
    "<p>The qubit oscillates, however, so to ensure that it actually \"sees\" the envelope as intended, the signal needs to be modulated with a <i>carrier signal</i> to transform in from the laboratory frame of reference into the qubit one.\n",
    "Finally, the scale of the pulse is determined by specifying a pulse <i>amplitude</i>.</p>\n",
    "</div></td>\n",

    "<tr></tr><tr><td></td>\n",
    "<td><div style=\"font-size: 70%\">Source: Wikipedia</div></td>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "A pulse envelope can be constructed directly and provided to QubiC in the form of a <span style=\"font-family:monospace\">numpy</span> array, exactly specifying the output value for each sample.\n",
    "However, it is much more efficient to provide parametrizations of pre-defined envelopes, such as those from QubiC's <i>pulse library</i> of commonly used ones.\n",
    "Such a parametrized envelope can be reused, e.g. different qubits can share the same envelope shape but different carrier frequencies and amplitudes, thus reducing the overall memory requirements of the system, which is essential to achieve scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulse Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "QubiC allows you to specify precisely when to start playing a pulse, using a start time counting from the beginning of the experiment.\n",
    "It uses human-readable, symbolic labels to specify the channel on which the pulse should be played.\n",
    "For example, \"Q1.qdrv\" refers to the qubit drive channel of qubit 1.\n",
    "A separate <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/LBL-QubiC/software/-/wikis/Understanding-Channel-Configuration\"><span style=\"font-family:monospace\">channel_config.json</span></a> file then tells the system to which actual hardware channel this corresponds.\n",
    "This approach makes pulse programs simpler to understand and keeps them portable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pulse start times are typically determined by pragmatic constraints, e.g. a different pulse on another qubit finishing first to reduce cross-talk.\n",
    "Since the qubit oscillates around the Z-axis, however, such timing in the laboratory frame translates into a phase in the qubit frame of reference.\n",
    "Thus, to have full control over the timing in the qubit frame, QubiC allows you to specify the <i>phase</i> of the carrier signal for the pulse at each place of use in the experiment."

    "\n",
    "QubiC provides APIs at several different levels, from the abstract to the low-level.\n",
    "The highest, circuit, level makes it a breeze to work with calibrated pulses and is also very human-readable.\n",
    "It provides operations for scheduling (delays) and synchronizatin (barriers)\n",
    "The circuit level is transformed to the compiled level, by taking the information from the configuration files we loaded above.\n",
    "The result, the compiled level, is very programmable and particularly useful if e.g. the pulses you design come from a different software stack, especially if that software already provides its own scheduling as at this level, time is absolute from a fixed start point.\n",
    "Finally, the compiled level gets assembled: the actual memory to copy over to the FPGA and the command words for QubiC to execute.\n",
    "This is particularly of use if you are interested in development of QubiC itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, the pulse descriptions are Python dictionaries with conventional labels as keys to the parameters of the pulse. Below are some annotated examples at the highest level."
